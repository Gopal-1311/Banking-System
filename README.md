Project by Gopal Guptafor the Data Analysis and Algorithm in Chandigarh University, under the guidance of Assistant Prof. Deepali Saini.

This system is for a bank owner to mange the accounts within their information by allowing them to create accounts, edit their information, perform transactions, delete them if necessary and search through them, sorted by any fields they desire.

Incorporates Linked Lists, Heap Sort, Binary Tree & Binary Search for various operations.

## How to use this?
This package uses no library other than what's included within the standard python library,
so you don't need to install anything. Just use a Python 3 interpreter and run the `bank.py`

```
% python3 bank.py
```
